# CLASSES

A class is a role-based archetype that determines a PC’s:

- **Access to Domains:** Each class grants access to two domains; players choose cards from these domains during character creation and when leveling up.
- **Starting Evasion and Hit Points (HP)**
- **Starting Items**
- **Class Feature(s)**
- **Class Hope Feature**, a class feature that costs 3 Hope to activate.

There are 9 classes in the Daggerheart core materials: [[Bard]], [[Druid]], [[Guardian]], [[Ranger]], [[Rogue]], [[Seraph]], [[Sorcerer]], [[Warrior]], and [[Wizard]].

## SUBCLASSES
Each class is divided into two **subclasses**, each of which further defines and highlights one aspect of its class archetype. Your chosen subclass grants the following:

- **Spellcast Trait**: the trait used on all Spellcast rolls.
- **Foundation Feature**: a unique starting feature that establishes the identity and strengths of the subclass.
- **Specialization Feature**: an advanced feature that can be gained on level up. For some subclasses, the specialization feature grants a new ability; for others, it expands or enhances a feature you already acquired through a class or subclass.
- **Mastery Feature**: The mastery feature is a subclass’s most powerful feature, which can be gained at higher levels. For some subclasses, the mastery feature unlocks an extraordinary new ability; for others, it’s the impressive culmination of their subclass’s core feature.

The Daggerheart core set includes cards detailing each foundation, specialization, and mastery feature. When you acquire one of these features, take its card for use as a reference during play.
