### ARMORED SENTRY
(Armadillo, Pangolin, Turtle, etc.)

Strength +1 | Evasion +1
*Melee Strength d8+2 phy*

**Gain advantage on**: [[dig]], [[locate]], [[protect]]

**Armored Shell**: Your hardened exterior gives you resistance to physical damage. Additionally, mark an Armor Slot to retract into your shell. While in your shell, physical damage is reduced by a number equal to your Armor Score (after applying resistance), but you can’t perform other actions without leaving this form.

**Cannonball**: Mark a Stress to allow an ally to throw or launch you at an adversary. To do so, the ally makes an attack roll using Agility or Strength (their choice) against a target within Close range. On a success, the adversary takes d12+2 physical damage using the thrower’s Proficiency. You can spend a Hope to target an additional adversary within Very Close range of the first. The second target takes half the damage dealt to the first target.
