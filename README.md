# Daggerheart SRD (Community Edition)

Welcome to the **Digital System Reference Document (SRD)** for [Daggerheart](https://www.darringtonpress.com/daggerheart/) â€” a community-driven resource designed to make the rules easy to browse, share, and build upon.

This project is hosted here on GitHub so that everyone can benefit from open access, collaboration, and contributions.

## ðŸš§ Work in Progress
This SRD is still being actively built out. Sections may be incomplete, reorganized, or updated frequently as content is added.  

## âœ¨ Whatâ€™s Inside
The goal is to have a Obsidian organized version of [Darrington Press' official SRD](https://www.daggerheart.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Daggerheart-SRD-9-09-25.pdf).
- ðŸ“– **Rules Reference** â€“ Core mechanics, character creation, and gameplay summaries.  
- ðŸ—‚ **Organized Notes** â€“ Clean, linked markdown files for easy navigation.  
- ðŸ’¡ **Community Additions** â€“ Optional modules, clarifications, and examples.
