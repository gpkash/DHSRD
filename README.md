# Daggerheart SRD (Community Edition)

Welcome to the **Markdown System Reference Document (SRD)** for [Daggerheart](https://www.darringtonpress.com/daggerheart/)! 

This project is a markdown version of the official Daggerheart Guidebook for a clean, searchable, and easy to use in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) or any other markdown-based knowledge tool.

## ðŸ“– About This Project
The aim of this repository is to provide GMs with:
- **Core Rules in Markdown** â€“ The official mechanics, character creation, and gameplay systems, adapted for quick reference.
- **Linked Notes** â€“ Well-structured files with internal links for fast navigation in Obsidian.
- **Community-Friendly Extensions** â€“ Space for clarifications, optional rules, and player-made resources.

This is **not** an official Darrington Press product. Itâ€™s a community-maintained resource built to make the SRD more accessible.

## ðŸš§ Status
This project is still a **work in progress**. Expect sections to be missing, reorganized, or updated frequently as the conversion continues. Contributions and feedback are very welcome!
