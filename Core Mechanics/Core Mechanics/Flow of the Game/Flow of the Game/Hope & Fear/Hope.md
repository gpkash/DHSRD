### HOPE
Every PC starts with 2 Hope at character creation and gains more throughout play. A PC can have a maximum of 6 Hope at one time, and Hope carries over between sessions.  

Players can spend Hope to:  

- **Help an Ally**  
  When you Help an Ally who is making an action roll, describe how you do so and roll an advantage die. Multiple players can spend Hope to help the same acting player, but that player only adds the highest result to their final total.  

- **Utilize an Experience**  
  When you Utilize an Experience on a relevant roll, add its modifier to the result. You can spend multiple Hope to utilize multiple Experiences.  

- **Initiate a Tag Team Roll**  
  Spend 3 Hope to initiate a Tag Team roll, combining the actions of two PCs into one impressive act of synergy. When you make a Tag Team roll, both players roll their action rolls and then choose which set of results to apply to the outcome.  

- **Activate a Hope Feature**  
  A Hope Feature is any effect that allows (or requires) you to spend a specified amount of Hope to activate it. **Class Hope features** are class-specific features, detailed on your character sheet, that cost 3 Hope to activate.  

> _**Note**: When using a Hope Feature, if you rolled with Hope for that action, the Hope you gain from that roll can be spent on that feature (or toward it, if it requires spending multiple Hope)._
