### MOVEMENT UNDER PRESSURE
When you’re under pressure or in danger and make an action roll, you can move to a location within Close range as part of that action. If you’re not already making an action roll, or if you want to move farther than your Close range, you need to succeed on an Agility Roll to safely reposition yourself.

An adversary can move within Close range for free as part of an action, or within Very Far range as a separate action.
