### Optional Rule: Defined Ranges
*If your table would rather operate with more precise range rules, you can use a 1-inch grid battle map during combat. If you do, use the following guidelines for play:*  

- **Melee:** 1 square  
- **Very Close:** 3 squares  
- **Close:** 6 squares  
- **Far:** 12 squares  
- **Very Far:** 13+ squares  
- **Out of Range:** Off the battlemap
