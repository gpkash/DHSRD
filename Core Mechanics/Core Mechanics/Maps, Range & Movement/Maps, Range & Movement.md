# MAPS, RANGE, AND MOVEMENT
You can play Daggerheart using “theater of the mind” or maps and miniatures. The conversions below from abstract ranges to physical measurements assume 1 inch of map represents about 5 feet of fictional space.  

Daggerheart uses the following **ranges** to translate fictional positioning into relative distance for the purposes of targeting, movement, and other game mechanics:  

- **Melee:** Close enough to touch, up to a few feet away.
- **Very Close:** Close enough to see fine details, about 5–10 feet away. While in danger, a character can move, as part of their action, from Very Close range into Melee range.
  *On a map: anything within the shortest length of a game card (2–3 inches).*
- **Close:** Close enough to see prominent details, about 10–30 feet away. While in danger, a character can move, as part of their action, from Close range into Melee range.
  *On a map: anything within the length of a pencil (5–6 inches).*
- **Far:** Close enough to see very little detail, about 30–100 feet away. While in danger, a character must make an Agility Roll to safely move from Far range into Melee range.
  *On a map: anything within the length of the long edge of a piece of copy paper (11–12 inches).*
- **Very Far:** Too far to make out any details, about 100–300 feet away. While in danger, a character must make an Agility Roll to safely move from Very Far range into Melee range.  
  *On a map: anything beyond Far range, but still within the bounds of the conflict or scene.*  
- **Out of Range:** Anything beyond a character’s Very Far range is Out of Range and usually can’t be targeted.

Range is measured from the source of an effect, such as the attacker or spellcaster, to the target or object of an effect.

A weapon, spell, ability, item, or other effect’s stated range is a maximum range; unless otherwise noted, it can be used at closer distances.
