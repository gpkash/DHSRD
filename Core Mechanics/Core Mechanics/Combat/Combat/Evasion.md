## EVASION
**Evasion** represents a character’s ability to avoid attacks and other unwanted effects. Any roll made against a PC has a Difficulty equal to the target’s Evasion. A PC’s base Evasion is determined by their class, but can be modified by domain cards, equipment, conditions, and other effects.  

> *Note: attacks rolled against adversaries use the target’s Difficulty instead of Evasion.*
