### LONG REST
A **long rest** is when the characters make camp and relax or sleep for several in-game hours. Each player can move domain cards between their loadout and vault for free, then choose twice from the following list of downtime moves (players can choose the same move twice):  

- **Tend to All Wounds:** Clear all Hit Points for yourself or an ally.  
- **Clear All Stress:** Clear all Stress.  
- **Repair All Armor:** Clear all Armor Slots from your or an ally’s armor.  
- **Prepare:** Describe how you prepare for the next day’s adventure, then gain a Hope. If you choose to Prepare with one or more members of your party, you each gain 2 Hope.  
- **Work on a Project:** With GM approval, a PC may pursue a long-term project, such as deciphering an ancient text or crafting a new weapon. The first time they start a new project, assign it a countdown. Each time a PC makes the Work on a Project move, they either advance their project’s countdown automatically or make an action roll to advance it (GM’s choice).  

At the end of a long rest, any features or effects with a limited number of uses per rest or per long rest refresh and any features or effects that last until your next rest or until your next long rest expire.
