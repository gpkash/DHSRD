### SHORT REST
A **short rest** lasts enough time for the party to catch its breath, about an hour in-world. Each player can move domain cards between their loadout and vault for free, then choose twice from the following list of downtime moves (players can choose the same move twice):  

- **Tend to Wounds:** Clear 1d4+Tier Hit Points for yourself or an ally.  
- **Clear Stress:** Clear 1d4+Tier Stress.  
- **Repair Armor:** Clear 1d4+Tier Armor Slots from your or an allyâ€™s armor.  
- **Prepare:** Describe how you prepare yourself for the path ahead, then gain a Hope. If you choose to Prepare with one or more members of your party, you each gain 2 Hope.  

At the end of a short rest, any features or effects with a limited number of uses per rest refresh and any features or effects that last until your next rest expire.
