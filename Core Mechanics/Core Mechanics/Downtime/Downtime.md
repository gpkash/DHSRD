# DOWNTIME
Between conflicts, the party can take a rest to recover expended resources and deepen their bonds. During a rest, each PC can make up to two downtime moves.  

When the party rests, they must choose between a short rest and a long rest. If a party takes three short rests in a row, their next rest must be a long rest.  

If a short rest is interrupted, such as by an adversary’s attack, the characters don’t gain its benefits. If a long rest is interrupted, the characters only gain the benefits of a short rest.
