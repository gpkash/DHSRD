### MULTIPLE DAMAGE SOURCES
Damage dealt simultaneously from multiple sources is always totaled before it’s compared to its target’s damage thresholds.  

> *For example, if a PC with orc ancestry makes a successful attack against a target in Melee range and decides to spend a Hope to use their “Tusks” feature (which gives them an extra 1d6 damage on a damage roll), they would roll their normal weapon damage and add a d6 to the result, then deal that total damage to the adversary.*
