### DAMAGE ROLLS
On a successful attack, roll damage. Damage is calculated from the **damage roll** listed in the attack’s description with the format “xdy+{modifier}” *(e.g., for a spell that inflicts “1d8+2” damage, you roll an eight-sided and add 2 to the result; the damage dealt is equal to the total)*. 

Any time an effect says to deal damage using your Spellcast trait, you roll a number of dice equal to your Spellcast trait.  

> **Note:** If your Spellcast trait is +0 or lower, you don’t roll anything.  

For weapons, the number of damage dice you roll is equal to your **Proficiency.** *Note that your Proficiency multiplies the number of dice you roll, but doesn’t affect the modifier. For example, a PC with Proficiency 2 and wielding a weapon with a damage rating of “d8+2” deals damage equal to “2d8+2” on a successful attack.*

Successful unarmed attacks inflict {Proficiency}d4 damage.
