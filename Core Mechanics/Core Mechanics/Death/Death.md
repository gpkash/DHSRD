# DEATH
When a PC marks their last Hit Point, they must make a **death move** by choosing one of the following options:  

- [[Blaze of Glory]]
- [[Avoid Death]]
- [[Risk It All]]

If your character dies, work with the GM before the next session to create a new character at the current level of the rest of the party.
