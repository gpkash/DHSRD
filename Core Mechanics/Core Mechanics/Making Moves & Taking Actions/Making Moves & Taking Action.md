# MAKING MOVES & TAKING ACTION
Any time a character does something to advance the story, such as speaking with another character, interacting with the environment, making an attack, casting a spell, or using a class feature, they are making a move.  

### ACTION ROLLS
Any move where success would be trivial or failure would be boring automatically succeeds, but any move that’s difficult to accomplish or risky to attempt triggers an **action roll.**  

### OVERVIEW
All action rolls require a pair of d12s called **Duality Dice.** These are two visually distinct twelve-sided dice, with one die representing Hope and the other representing Fear.  

To make an action roll, you roll the Duality Dice, sum the results, apply any relevant modifiers, and compare the total to a Difficulty number to determine the outcome:  

- **Success with Hope:** If your total meets or beats the Difficulty AND your Hope Die shows a higher result than your Fear Die, you rolled a “Success with Hope.” You succeed and gain a Hope.  
- **Success with Fear:** If your total meets or beats the Difficulty AND your Fear Die shows a higher result than your Hope Die, you rolled a “Success with Fear.” You succeed with a cost or complication, but the GM gains a Fear.  
- **Failure with Hope:** If your total is less than the Difficulty AND your Hope Die shows a higher result than your Fear Die, you rolled a “Failure with Hope.” You fail with a minor consequence and gain a Hope, then the spotlight swings to the GM.  
- **Failure with Fear:** If your total is less than the Difficulty AND your Fear Die shows a higher result than your Hope Die, you rolled a “Failure with Fear.” You fail with a major consequence and the GM gains a Fear, then the spotlight swings to the GM.  
- **Critical Success:** If the Duality Dice show matching results, you rolled a “Critical Success” (“Crit”). You automatically succeed with a bonus, gain a Hope, and clear a Stress. If this was an attack roll, you deal critical damage.  

*Note: A Critical Success counts as a roll “with Hope.”*  

After resolving the action roll, the table works together to weave the outcome into the narrative and play continues.  

##### FAILING FORWARD
In Daggerheart, every time you roll the dice, the scene changes in some way. There is no such thing as a roll where “nothing happens,” because the fiction constantly evolves based on the successes and failures of the characters.  

### PROCEDURE
Every action roll follows in more detail the procedure that all action rolls utilize:  

##### STEP 1: PICK AN APPROPRIATE TRAIT
Some actions and effects specify in their description which trait applies to the roll; otherwise, the GM tells the acting player which character trait best applies to the action being attempted. If more than one trait could apply to the roll, the GM chooses or lets the acting player decide.  

##### STEP 2: DETERMINE THE DIFFICULTY
Some actions and features say in their description what the Difficulty is. Otherwise, the GM determines the Difficulty based on the scenario. The GM can choose whether to share the Difficulty with the table. In either case, the GM should communicate the potential consequences of failure to the acting player.  

##### STEP 3: APPLY EXTRA DICE AND MODIFIERS
The acting player decides whether to Utilize an Experience or activate other effects, then, if applicable, adds the appropriate tokens and dice (such as advantage or Rally dice) to their dice pool.  

> _**Note**: Unless an action, ability, or feature specifically allows for it, a player must declare the use of any Experiences, extra dice, or other modifiers before they roll._

##### STEP 4: ROLL THE DICE
The acting player rolls their entire dice pool and announces the results in the format of “{total result} with {Hope/Fear}”—or “Critical Success!” in the case of matching Duality Dice.

> *Example: A player is making an action roll with a +1 in the relevant trait and no other modifiers; they roll the Duality Dice and get a result of 5 on their Hope Die and 7 on their Fear Die, then announce “I rolled a 13 with Fear!”*  

##### STEP 5: RESOLVE THE OUTCOME
The active player and the GM work together, along with the suggestions and support of the rest of the table, to resolve the outcome of the action.
