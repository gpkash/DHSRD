## ADVERSARY ACTIONS
When play passes to the GM, the GM can make a GM move to spotlight an adversary. A spotlighted adversary can:  

- Move within Close range and make a standard attack  
- Move within Close range and use an adversary action  
- Clear a condition  
- Sprint within Far or Very Far range on the battlefield  
- Do anything else the fiction demands or the GM deems appropriate  

The GM can spend additional Fear to spotlight additional adversaries. Once the GM has finished, the spotlight swings back to the PCs.
