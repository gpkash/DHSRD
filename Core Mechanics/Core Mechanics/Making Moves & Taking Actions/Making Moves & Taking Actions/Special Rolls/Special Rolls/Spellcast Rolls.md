### SPELLCAST ROLLS
**Spellcast Rolls** are trait rolls that require you to use your Spellcast trait. Your Spellcast trait, if you have one, is determined by your subclass.  

Spellcast Rolls are only made when a character uses a feature that requires one. A successful Spellcast Roll activates the effect as described by the feature.  

> ### Notes:
> A Spellcast Roll that can damage a target is also considered an attack roll.  
> 
> When you cast a spell, the text tells you when the effect ends. The GM can spend a Fear to end a temporary effect. If your spell doesnâ€™t specify when it ends, it ends when you choose or at a natural moment of the story. You can choose to end your spell early.  
> 
> You can cast and maintain the effects of more than one spell at the same time.
