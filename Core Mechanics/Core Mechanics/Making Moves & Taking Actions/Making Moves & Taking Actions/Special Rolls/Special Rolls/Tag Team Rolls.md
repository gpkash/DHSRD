### TAG TEAM ROLLS
Each player can, once per session, initiate a Tag Team Roll between their character and another PC by spending 3 Hope. The players work with one another to describe how they combine their actions in a unique and exciting way. Both players make separate action rolls; before resolving the rollâ€™s outcome, choose one of the rolls to apply to both actions. On a roll with Hope, all PCs involved gain a Hope. On a roll with Fear, the GM gains a Fear token for each PC involved.  

On a successful Tag Team attack roll, both players roll damage and add the totals together to determine the damage dealt, which is then treated as if it came from a single source. If the attacks deal different types of damage, the players choose which type to deal.  

> ### Notes:
> - A Tag Team Roll counts as a single action roll for the purposes of any countdowns or features that track action rolls.  
> - Though each player may only initiate one Tag Team Roll per session, one PC can be involved in multiple Tag Team Rolls.
