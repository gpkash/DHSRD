## ADVANTAGE & DISADVANTAGE
Some features and effects let you roll with advantage or disadvantage on an action or reaction roll:  

- [[Advantage]] 
- [[Disadvantage]]

Advantage or disadvantage can be granted or imposed by mechanical triggers or at the GM’s discretion. When a PC aids you with Help an Ally, they roll their own advantage die and you add it to your total.

Advantage and disadvantage dice cancel each out, one-for-one, when they would be added to the same dice pool, so you’ll never roll both at the same time. If you have advantage or disadvantage from other sources that don’t affect your own dice pool, such as another player’s Help an Ally move, their effects stack with your rolled results.
