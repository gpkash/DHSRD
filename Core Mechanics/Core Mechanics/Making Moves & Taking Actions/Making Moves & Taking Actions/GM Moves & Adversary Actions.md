## GM MOVES & ADVERSARY ACTIONS
GMs also make moves. They should consider making a move when a player does one of the following things:  

- Rolls with Fear on an action roll.  
- Fails an action roll.  
- Does something that would have consequences.  
- Gives them a golden opportunity.  
- Looks to them for what happens next.  

After the GM turn is done, the spotlight goes back to the PCs.  

Many adversaries and environments have **Fear Features,** especially powerful or consequential moves that the GM must spend Fear to activate.  

*Note: This Fear is in addition to any Fear the GM has previously spent to seize the spotlight or activate another action or ability.*
