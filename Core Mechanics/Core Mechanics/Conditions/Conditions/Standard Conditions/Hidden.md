### HIDDEN
While you’re out of sight from all enemies and they don’t otherwise know your location, you gain the **Hidden** condition. Any rolls against a Hidden creature have disadvantage. After an adversary moves to where they would see you, you move into their line of sight, or you make an attack, you are no longer Hidden.
