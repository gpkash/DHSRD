# CONDITIONS
Conditions are effects that grant specific benefits or drawbacks to the target they are attached to.  

## STANDARD CONDITIONS
*Daggerheart* has three standard conditions:

- [[Vulnerable]]

### [[Temporary Tags & Special Conditions]]

**Special conditions** are only cleared when specific requirements are met, such as completing a certain action or using a particular item. The requirements for clearing these conditions are stated in the text of the effect that applies the condition.
