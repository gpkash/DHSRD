# TURN ORDER & ACTION ECONOMY
Daggerheart’s turns don’t follow a traditional, rigid format: there is no explicit initiative mechanic and characters don’t have a set number of actions they can take or things they can do before the spotlight passes to someone else. A player with the spotlight describes what their character does and the spotlight simply swings to whoever:  

A. the fiction would naturally turn it toward  
B. hasn’t had the focus in a while, or  
C. a triggered mechanic puts it on
