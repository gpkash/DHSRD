# EQUIPMENT
Your **equipped** weapons and armor are the ones listed in the “Active Weapons” and “Active Armor” sections of your character sheet. Your character can only attack with weapons, benefit from armor, and gain features from items they have equipped. You can’t equip weapons or armor with a higher tier than you.  

PCs can carry up to two additional weapons in the “Inventory Weapon” areas of the character sheet.  

You can swap an Inventory Weapon with an Active Weapon of the same burden at no cost during a rest or moment of calm; otherwise, you must mark a Stress to do so.  

Your character can only have one Active Armor at a time. They can’t equip armor while in danger or under pressure; otherwise, they can equip or unequip armor without cost. Each armor has its own Armor Slots; if your character unequips their armor, track how many of its Armor Slots are marked. You can't carry armor in your inventory. When your character equips or unequips armor, recalculate your damage thresholds.
