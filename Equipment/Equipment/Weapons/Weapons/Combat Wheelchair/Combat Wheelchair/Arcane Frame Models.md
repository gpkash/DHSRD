## COMBAT WHEELCHAIR
### Arcane Frame Models  

These wheelchairs have frames that are attuned to your character and their magic, allowing them to channel their spells through the chair. Unlike other primary magic weapons, the arcane-frame model doesnâ€™t specify a trait to use when making an attack with it. Instead, you use the Spellcast trait indicated by your subclass.
