# GOLD

Gold is an abstract measurement of how much wealth a character has, and is measured in **handfuls, bags, and chests**, with 10 handfuls to 1 bag, and 10 bags to 1 chest. When you have marked all of the slots in a category and you gain another gold reward in that category, mark a slot in the following category and clear all the slots in the current one.  

For example, if you have 9 handfuls and gain another, you instead mark 1 bag and erase all handfuls. If you have 9 bags and gain another, you mark 1 chest and erase all bags.  

You can’t have more than 1 chest, so if all your Gold slots are marked, you’ll need to spend some of your gold or store it somewhere else before you can acquire more.  

> ### Optional Rule: Gold Coins
> If your group wants to track gold with more granularity, you can add **coins** as your lowest denomination. Following the established pattern, 10 coins equal 1 handful.
