# DOMAIN CARDS

Each domain card provides one or more features your PC can utilize during their adventures. Some domain cards provide moves you can make, such as a unique attack or a spell. Others offer passive effects, new downtime or social encounter abilities, or one-time benefits.

#### DOMAIN CARD ANATOMY

Each domain card includes six elements:

#####  Level

The number in the top left of the card indicates the card’s level. You cannot acquire a domain card with a level higher than your PC’s.

##### Domain

Beneath the card’s level there is a symbol indicating its domain. You can only choose cards from your class’s two [[Domains]].

##### Recall Cost

The number and lightning bolt in the top right of the card shows its [[Recall Cost]]. This is the amount of [[Stress]] a player must mark to swap this card from their [[Loadout & Vault|vault]] with a card from their [[Loadout & Vault|loadout]].

> _**Note**: A player can swap domain cards during downtime without paying the domain card’s [[Recall Cost]]._

##### Title

The name of the card.

##### Type

The card’s type is listed in the center above the title. There are three types of domain cards: **[[abilities]]**, **[[spells]]**, and **[[grimoires]]**. Abilities are typically non-magical in nature, while spells are magical. Grimoires are unique to the [[Codex]] domain and grant access to a collection of less potent spells. Some game mechanics only apply to certain types of cards.

##### Feature

The text on the bottom half of the card describes its feature(s), including any special rules you need to follow when you use that card.

#### [[Loadout & Vault]]

#### USAGE LIMITS

If a domain card restricts how often it can be used, you can track such limits with whatever method you prefer, such as turning the card sideways, flipping it facedown, or using tokens.

_**Note**: if an effect or ability gives you a number of uses equal to a trait with a modifier of +0 or less, it grants you 0 uses._
