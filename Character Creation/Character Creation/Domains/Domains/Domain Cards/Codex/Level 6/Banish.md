## BANISH  
_Codex Domain_

**Level 6 Codex Spell**  
**Recall Cost: 0**

Make a Spellcast Roll against a target within Close range. On a success, roll a number of **d20s** equal to your Spellcast trait. The target must make a reaction roll with a Difficulty equal to your highest result. On a success, the target must mark a Stress but isn’t banished. Once per rest on a failure, they are banished from this realm.  

When the PCs roll with Fear, the Difficulty gains a −1 penalty and the target makes another reaction roll. On a success, they return from banishment.
