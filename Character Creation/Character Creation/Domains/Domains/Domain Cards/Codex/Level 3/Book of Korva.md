**Levitation:** Make a Spellcast Roll to temporarily lift a target you can see up into the air and move them within Close range of their original position.  

**Rescent:** Spend a Hope to force a target within Melee range to make a Reaction Roll (15). On a failure, they forget the last minute of your conversation.  

**Rune Circle:** Mark a Stress to create a temporary magic circle on the ground where you stand. All adversaries within Melee range, or who enter Melee range, take **2d12+4** magic damage and are knocked back to Very Close range.
