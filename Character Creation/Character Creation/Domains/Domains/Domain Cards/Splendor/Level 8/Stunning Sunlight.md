## STUNNING SUNLIGHT  
_Splendor Domain_

**Level 8 Splendor Spell**  
**Recall Cost: 2**  

Make a Spellcast Roll to unleash powerful rays of burning sunlight against all adversaries in front of you within Far range. On a success, spend any number of Hope and force that many targets you succeeded against to make a Reaction Roll (14).  

Targets who succeeded take 3d10+3 magic damage. Targets who fail take 4d20+5 magic damage and are temporarily Stunned. While Stunned, they can’t use reactions and can’t take any other actions until they clear this condition.
