## MASS ENRAPTURE  
_Grace Domain_

**Level 8 Grace Spell**  
**Recall Cost: 3**

Make a Spellcast Roll against all targets within Far range. Targets you succeed against become temporarily Enraptured. While Enraptured, a targetâ€™s attention is fixed on you, narrowing their field of view and drowning out any sound but your voice. Mark a Stress to force all Enraptured targets to mark a Stress, ending this spell.
