Spend a Hope and make an attack against all adversaries within your weaponâ€™s range. Once per long rest, on a success against any targets, add up the damage dealt, then redistribute that damage however you wish between the targets you succeeded against. When you deal damage to a target, roll an additional damage die and add its result to the damage you deal to that target.
