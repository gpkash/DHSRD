## KNOW THY ENEMY  
_Bone Domain_

**Level 5 Bone Ability**  
**Recall Cost: 1**

When observing a creature, you can make an Instinct Roll against them. On a success, spend a Hope and ask the GM for one set of information about the target from the following options:  

- Their unmarked Hit Points and Stress.  
- Their Difficulty and damage thresholds.  
- Their tactics and standard attack damage dice.  
- Their Features and Experiences.  

If you fail the Instinct Roll, you can **mark a Stress** to remove a Fear from the GMâ€™s Fear Pool.
