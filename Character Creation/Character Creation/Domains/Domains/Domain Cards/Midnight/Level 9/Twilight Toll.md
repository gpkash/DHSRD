## TWILIGHT TOLL  
_Midnight Domain_

**Level 9 Midnight Ability**  
**Recall Cost: 1**  

Choose a target within Far range. When you succeed on an action roll against them that doesnâ€™t result in making a damage roll, place a token on this card. When you deal damage to this target, spend any number of tokens to add a d12 for each token spent to your damage roll. You can only hold Twilight Toll on one creature at a time.  

When you choose a new target or take a rest, clear all unspent tokens.
