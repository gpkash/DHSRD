## VEIL OF NIGHT  
_Midnight Domain_

**Level 3 Midnight Spell**  
**Recall Cost: 1**  

Make a Spellcast Roll (13). On a success, you can create a temporary curtain of darkness between two points within Far range. Only you can see through this darkness. Youâ€™re considered Hidden to adversaries on the other side of the veil, and you have advantage on attacks you make through the darkness. The veil remains until you cast another spell.
