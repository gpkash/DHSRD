## CHOKEHOLD  
_Midnight Domain_

**Level 3 Midnight Ability**  
**Recall Cost: 1**  

When you position yourself behind a creature whoâ€™s about your size, you can mark a Stress to pull them into a chokehold, making them temporarily Vulnerable.  

When a creature attacks a target who is Vulnerable in this way, they deal an extra 2d6 damage.
