## NATURE’S TONGUE  
_Sage Domain_

**Level 1 Sage Ability**  
**Recall Cost: 0**  

You can speak the language of the natural world. When you want to speak to the plants and animals around you, make an **Instinct Roll (12).** On a success, they’ll give you the information they know. On a roll with Fear, their knowledge might be limited or come at a cost.  

Additionally, before you make a Spellcast Roll while within a natural environment, you can **spend a Hope** to gain a +2 bonus to the roll.
