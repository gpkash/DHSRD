## FOREST SPRITES  
_Sage Domain_

**Level 8 Sage Spell**  
**Recall Cost: 2**  

Make a Spellcast Roll (13). On a success, **spend any number of Hope** to create an equal number of small forest sprites who appear at points you choose within Far range, providing the following benefits:  
- Your allies gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls against adversaries within Melee range of a sprite.  
- An ally who marks an Armor Slot while within Melee range of a sprite can mark an additional Armor Slot.  

A sprite vanishes after granting a benefit or taking any damage.
