## CLOAKING BLAST  
_Arcana Domain_

**Level 7 Arcana Spell**  
**Recall Cost: 2**

When you make a successful Spellcast Roll to cast a different spell, you can **spend a Hope** to become Cloaked. While Cloaked, you remain unseen if you are stationary when an adversary moves to where they would normally see you. When you move into or within an adversaryâ€™s line of sight or make an attack, you are no longer Cloaked.
