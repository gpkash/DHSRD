# MIXED ANCESTRY
Families within the world of Daggerheart are as unique as the peoples and cultures that inhabit it. Anyone’s appearance and abilities can be shaped by blood, magic, proximity, or a variety of other factors.  

If you decide that your character is a descendant of multiple [[ancestries]] and you want to mechanically represent that in the game, use the steps below:  

1. **Determine Ancestry Combination**  
   When you choose an ancestry at [[character creation]], write down how your character identifies themself in the Heritage section of your character sheet. For example, if your character is descended from both goblins and orcs, you could use a hybridized term, such as “[[goblin]]-[[orc]].” To describe your ancestry, list only the ancestry you more closely identify with (e.g., just “[[goblin]]” or just “[[orc]]”), or invent a new term, such as “toothling.”  

2. **Choose Ancestry Features**  
   Work with your GM to choose two features from the [[ancestries]] in your character’s lineage. You must choose the first feature from one ancestry and the second from another. Write both down on a notecard you can keep with your other cards or next to your character sheet.  

*For example, if you are making a [[goblin]]-[[orc]], you might take the “Surefooted” and “Tusks” features or the “Sturdy” and “Danger Sense” features. You can’t take both the “Surefooted” and “Sturdy” features, because these are both the first features listed on their respective ancestry cards.*  

Your character’s heritage might include more than two [[ancestries]], but you still only choose features from two. You can represent additional [[ancestries]] through their appearance or backstory.
